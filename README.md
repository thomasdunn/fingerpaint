Fingerpaint
===========

*Draw in the browser with your fingers*

Fingerpaint is a web browser application letting you fingerpaint on a multitouch device, such as a touchscreen monitor or smartphone. It is designed to be very simple - just the minimum tools necessary to simulate painting with your fingers. It is multi-touch enabled, so don't be afraid to use both hands (or both thumbs :)!
